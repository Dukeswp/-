    "# Getting Started with Cantera: Python/Jupyter Notebook Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook was written by Dan Haworth, borrowing from \"python_tutorial.ipynb\" at https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook was last updated 3 February 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first in a series of tutorial Notebooks that has been developed to parallel the fourth edition of the book \"An Introduction to Combustion: Concepts and Applications\" by Stephen R. Turns and Daniel C. Haworth. That book is referred to as \"Turns 4th ed.\" in this Notebook, while \"Turns 3rd ed.\" refers to the 2012 third edition. This Notebook, and all of the subsequent tutorial Notebooks, was created and tested using Cantera version 2.4.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this tutorial is to provide a basic understanding of how to work with Cantera using the Python/Jupyter Notebook interface. This includes general information on Notebook structure and syntax, and on defining and working with a reacting gas mixture using Cantera. The material here may help you to brush up on some basic thermodynamics, an important prerequisite as you begin your study of combustion. Thermodynamics is covered more extensively in Chapter 2 of Turns 4th ed., and in the Chapter 2 tutorial Notebooks. This Notebook also provides introductory examples of basic mathematical operations using NumPy and of x-y plot generation using Matplotlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the most out of this tutorial Notebook, and subsequent Notebooks, you should work through the Notebook sequentially cell-by-cell, from top to bottom; see \"Jupyter Notebook basics\" below for how to do that. More specifically, you should actively open and run each cell in the Notebook, and experiment to see what happens if you make changes in each cell. That will be a much more effective way to learn, compared to passively reading the Notebook content. You can always download a fresh version of the original Notebook, if necessary. The Notebooks are intended to be self-contained, and the material is cumulative. Each Notebook typically introduces some new information on how to perform various useful basic operations (e.g., manipulating objects in Python, working with arrays, plotting, . . .), in addition to covering new subject material on combustion that parallels the development in Turns 4th ed. For that reason, you should work through the Notebooks in the intended sequential order, and not skip any Notebooks. For further information and deeper insight, the interested reader can explore the links that are provided throughout the Notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for the image in the cell that is two cells below the current cell to display properly, the file \"Turns3cover.jpg\" (provided with this Notebook) must be placed in a folder or directory named \"images\" that is immediately below the folder or directory from which you have opened this Notebook. If you downloaded the .zip file that contains all of the tutorial Notebooks, the appropriate folder and file structure should be in place."

    "A Notebook consists of a sequence of \"cells\", where each cell has a \"Cell Type\". This Notebook contains two cell types: Cell Type \"Markdown\" for text, hyperlinks, equations, and figures/videos; and Cell Type \"Code\" for executable statements. The text that you are reading is in a Markdown cell. To see that, left-click anywhere on this text. The cell will then be highlighted, and the cell type will be indicated in the pull-down menu box of cell types on the toolbar above. The two cells above this cell are also Markdown cells, as are the two cells immediately below this cell. The first Code cell in this Notebook is the one that starts with the line \"import cantera . . .\" You can change a cell from one cell type to a different cell type by left-clicking on the cell, and using the pull-down menu of cell types to select the desired type. There are options other than \"Markdown\" and \"Code\", but we will not need those for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Markdown cells\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit the contents of this cell (or any Markdown cell) by double-left-clicking on the cell. You will then see the \"raw\" cell content, and you can type in any desired content. Then press the \"Run\" button on the toolbar above to render the cell and see the result. \"Markdown\" is a markup language that is a superset of HTML. Examples of what can be done in a Markdown cell can be found at https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html. A few basic examples are provided in the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a hyperlink to any text by enclosing the text in square brackets, followed by the location of the link in parentheses. For example, clicking on the words \"Markdown documentation\" that follow accesses the same documentation as the link in the previous paragraph: [Markdown documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the format of the text (among other things) using the \"open the command palette\" icon at the far right on the toolbar above. For example, you can select \"change cell to heading 2\" there to change the font of the text in this cell to the font that is used in the cell immediately above this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can display text using monospace font by enclosing the text in backticks, or back quotes: `this text is enclosed between backticks, and is displayed using monospace font.` We will use this font style when referring to various code statements in our Notebooks. Similarly, you can display text using italic font by enclosing the text between asterisks: *this text is enclosed between asterisks, and is displayed using italic font*. And you can display text using bold font by enclosing the text between double asterisks: **this text is enclosed between double asterisks, and is displayed using bold font**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a bulleted list by typing an asterisk at the beginning of each new line:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bullet point 1\n",
    "* Bullet point 2\n",
    "\n",
    "You can display inline or separate-line LaTeX-formatted equations using single or double dollar signs, respectively. For example, here is an inline equation: $ A_{sphere} = 4 \\pi r^2 $. And here is an equation that is displayed on its own line: $$ V_{sphere} = {4 \\over 3} \\pi r^3 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can insert a figure or a video by referring to an available image or video file. For example, the image file named \"Turns3cover.jpg\" is an image of the cover of Turns 3rd ed. The image file can be anywhere on your computer's file system; you just need to point to where it is. If the image file is in a subfolder named \"images\" immediately under the current working folder (the folder from which you are running this Notebook), the image can be displayed as follows: <img src=\"images/Turns3cover.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Several standard image file formats are supported: see https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/file_formats.html. Videos can be imported and displayed in a similar manner. An image file can also be accessed and inserted using the toolbar. To do that, select \"Insert Image\" from the pulldown menu under \"Edit\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "After you have made all of the desired changes to the content of a Markdown cell, you can left-click the \"Run\" button on the toolbar to see the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit the content of a Code cell by (single) left-clicking on the cell and typing in content. Once you have made all of the desired changes to cell content, left-click the \"Run\" button on the toolbar to see the result. Depending on what is in the Code cell, no output may be generated, text and/or plot output may be displayed immediately below the cell, a new window may open, and/or an output file may be written to your computer. Examples are provided in the remainder of this Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you run each cell, the next cell in the Notebook will be highlighted. You can edit that cell as desired, and left-click the \"Run\" button to run that cell. In that manner, you can work sequentially through this (or any other) Notebook. You can run cells in any order, but you are likely to get unexpected results if you do not run the Code cells in the order intended: sequentially from top to bottom of the Notebook. You can also run one or more cells from the pull-down menu in the toolbar under \"Cell\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic information on the syntax of a Code cell is provided below, following the first Code cell in this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see later, some Code cells may require several seconds, minutes, or even longer to execute. That will not be the case for most of the Code cells in this Notebook. The small circle after \"Python 3\" at the upper-right-hand corner of the toolbar indicates whether or not a cell is running. If the circle is filled in (dark), then the Code cell is still running. If the circle is not filled in (light), then the Code cell is not running. You also can hover the cursor over the circle. If it says \"Kernel Busy\", then the Code cell is still running. If it says \"Kernel Idle\", then it is not running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Other Notebook basics\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what each icon on the toolbar above does, hover the cursor over the icon. Using the icons, you can create (insert) a new cell, remove (cut) cells, copy cells, move cells up or down in the Notebook, or run cells, among other things. You can also browse the pulldown menus under \"File\", \"Edit\", \"View\", etc. (left-click to access pull-down menu for each) to see what can be done from there. For example, several options for running individual cells or groups of cells can be found in the pull-down menu under \"Cell\", as noted above.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A Notebook is automatically saved periodically as you work. You can manually force a Save and Checkpoint at any time by pressing the \"Save and Checkpoint\" button, or by selecting \"File/Save and Checkpoint\" from the toolbar. You can rename your Notebook by selecting \"File/Rename...\" And you can close your Notebook by selecting \"File/Close and Halt\"; that will generate a warning if you have made changes since the last Save and Checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Other sources of information for beginning users\n",
    "\n",
    "Several online tutorials and other sources of information are available for Python, Notebooks, and other packages. The interested reader can do a web search. Here are a few sources of introductory material that have been useful to other Cantera users:\n",

    "The first thing that needs to be done in most applications is to access the various packages that will be used. For our purposes, the five packages that are imported below will be sufficient, in most cases. These five lines access Cantera, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and SciPy, respectively. [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) is a package for scientific computing in Python. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a package that provides Matlab-like plotting capabilities; here we use the [pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) interface.

The names are case sensitive, and different names may be used for the same species in different input data files, as we will see in subsequent tutorials.

At ambient conditions, one would expect that most hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen present in a gas mixture would be in the form of diatomic molecules (H2, O2, and N2, respectively), and that is indeed the case. However, as we will see, during combustion these diatomic molecules can dissociate, or split apart, into free H, O, and N atoms. These atoms (note that they are electrically neutral - they are not ions) can be important thermodynamically and chemically, and their properties are very different from those of their corresponding diatomic molecules, so they must be considered as separate species in the mixture. Similarly, free carbon atoms (C) may appear during the combustion process, although free carbon itself is usually not very important in gas-phase combustion of hydrocarbon fuels with air. And finally, argon (AR) is included in gri30.cti, as discussed above.  \n",

    "A few observations can be made. The value of C_p increases with increasing temperature, and the rate of increase decreases with increasing temperature. The reasons for this behavior are explained in Chapter 2 of Turns 4th ed., and in classical thermodynamics texts. The increase is significant over the range 300 K to 2500 K, which is a temperature range that is of interest for many practical combustion applications. This suggests that it might not be appropriate to assume constant specific heats in some combustion problems.\n",

    "Again, this figure can be compared with Figure 2.2 in Turns 4th ed. Note the unphysical decrease in the specific heat of CO2 with increasing T, and the unphysical increase in the specific heat of H2O with increasing T, at temperatures higher than approximately 3500 K. Apparently the polynomial coefficients used in gri30.cti to describe the temperature variation of specific heats are different than those used in Turns 4th ed. (Table A.13). This underscores the importance of limiting the use of thermochemical data to the range of conditions for which it was intended."
