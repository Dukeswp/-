    "# Well-Stirred Reactor\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook was written by Dan Haworth. It was adapted from the Notebook \"stirred_reactor.ipynb\" at https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-jupyter/tree/master/reactors. It is intended as a tutorial to be used in parallel with Chapter 6 of the book \"An Introduction to Combustion: Concepts and Applications\" by Stephen R. Turns and Daniel C. Haworth. That book is referred to as \"Turns 4th ed.\" throughout this Notebook.\n",

    "The objective of this tutorial is to show how to simulate a well-stirred reactor (WSR) using Cantera, and to illustrate basic WSR behavior. More information on [Cantera zero-dimensional reactor networks](https://cantera.org/documentation/docs-2.4/sphinx/html/cython/zerodim.html) is provided. The tutorial also provides an example of how one can import external data (here, experimental data) into Cantera, and plot a quantitative comparison between Cantera model results and experimental data. We will use the thermodynamic properties and reaction mechanism that are included in galway.cti.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files \"galway.cti\" (reaction mechanism input data file, provided with this Notebook) and \"zhangExpData.csv\" (experimental data in Excel-compatible .csv format) must be placed in a folder or directory named \"data\" that is immediately below the folder or directory from which you have opened this Notebook. And the files \"Figure6p5_Turns4thed.png\" and \"CanteraWSRModel.png\" (image files) must be placed in a folder or directory named \"images\" that is immediately below the folder or directory from which you have opened this Notebook. If you downloaded the .zip file that contains all of the tutorial Notebooks, the appropriate folder and file structure should be in place.

    "The reactor is stirred (by a fan, for example) with sufficient intensity to ensure that the mixture temperature and composition in the reactor are spatially homogeneous. This configuration is also referred to as a *perfectly stirred reactor* (PSR), a *continuously stirred tank reactor* (CSTR), a *jet-stirred reactor* (JSR), or a *Longwell reactor*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reactor temperature, pressure, volume, and composition (in terms of species $i$ mass fractions) are denoted as $T$, $P$, $V$, and $Y_i$, respectively. The reactor volume $V$ is fixed. In general, the other quantities can vary in time, although here we will consider the case where the pressure is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the fixed-mass batch reactors considered earlier, this is an open system. A gas mixture with a prescribed temperature (or enthalpy), pressure, and composition enters the reactor at the inlet with mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$. And a gas mixture whose temperature (or enthalpy), pressure, and composition correspond to the instantanous values in the reactor exits the reactor at the outlet. In steady-state operation (the case of interest here), the reactor temperature, pressure, and composition are constant in time, and the the outlet mass flow rate is equal to the inlet mass flow rate $ \\dot{m}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "A key quantity in understanding WSR behavior is the *residence time* $\\tau$. This is the average time that a parcel of the gas mixture spends in the reactor. The residence time is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\tau = \\frac{m}{\\dot{m}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the instantaneous mass of the gas mixture in the reactor (which is constant, in the case of steady-state operation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in modeling a WSR is to compute the thermochemical state of the mixture in the reactor (its temperature, pressure, and composition), given the thermochemical state of the inlet mixture and the residence time $\\tau$ (or equivalently, the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different scenarios are considered in this Notebook. In the first scenario, the reactor temperature is given and is equal to the inlet temperature. In that case, it is not necessary to solve an energy equation. In the second scenario, the reactor temperature is computed as part of the solution, assuming no heat transfer between the mixture in the reactor and its surroundings (adiabatic system). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second scenario, it is necessary to solve an energy equation, and the behavior of the system as $\\tau$ is varied (for a given inlet thermochemical state) is of particular interest: \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the limit as $\\tau \\rightarrow \\infty $, the outlet temperature and composition can be expected to reach chemical equilibrium: specifically, the constant-pressure, constant-enthalpy equilibrium corresponding to the inlet thermochemical state, since this is a constant-pressure adiabatic system. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the limit as $\\tau \\rightarrow 0$, the outlet temperature and composition can be expected to remain at the inlet values, since there is insufficient time for chemical reactions to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For intermediate values of $\\tau$, the outlet temperature and composition can be expected to lie somewhere between the inlet values and the equilibrium values. For example, consider a case where the inlet conditions correspond to a fuel-oxidizer reactant mixture at a specified temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio. Then starting with a residence time that is sufficiently long that the outlet thermochemical state corresponds to chemical equilibrium (with the equilibrium temperature being greater than inlet temperature), the outlet temperature should decrease with decreasing residence time. However, the outlet temperature typically will not decrease smoothly toward the inlet temperature as the residence time is decreased toward zero. At a particular critical value of the residence time, whose value depends on the inlet thermochemical state, the outlet temperature will suddenly drop to the inlet temperature and the outlet composition will be the same as the inlet condition. For residence times smaller than the critical residence time, there is insufficient time for the chemical reactions needed to break down the fuel and oxidizer to take place. This critical residence time is referred to as the reactor *blowout* residence time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the WSR is very sensitive to chemical kinetics rates, and the outlet temperature and composition can be varied over a wide range simply by varying the residence time, and blowout occurs at a very specific value of the residence time that is determined by the inlet thermochemical state, the WSR is a useful configuration for exploring chemical kinetics and for developing and validating reaction mechanisms. See Chapter 6 of Turns 4th ed. for further discussion."

    "The equations governing the evolution of a constant-pressure WSR in steady-state operation can be found in Chapter 6 of Turns 4th ed. For steady-state operation, these equations can be written as a sytem of coupled nonlinear *algebraic* equations (versus ordinary differential equations). Here we consider cases where the reactor mixture temperature is given, and is equal to the inlet mixture temperature. This implies that the reactor must be nonadiabatic. In Section 4 below, we will consider a case where we solve for the reactor temperature as part of the solution, and the reactor is taken to be adiabatic."

    "As was the case for the fixed-mass batch reactors considered earlier, we do not need to explicitly provide the system of equations that are to be solved to Cantera. However, because a WSR has an inlet and an outlet, the setup is more involved than for the fixed-mass batch reactors that have been considered up to this point. Moreover, while we are interested in steady-state reactor operation, in Cantera we will perform an unsteady simulation starting from a given initial condition in the reactor, and we will integrate in time until steady-state is reached. The choice of initial conditions is arbitrary in principle, but in practice, the closer the assumed initial conditions are to the final steady-state solution, the lower the computational time will be.\n",

In addition to the reactor itself, on the inlet side we define an upstream reservoir using a Cantera [`Reservoir()`](https://cantera.org/documentation/docs-2.4/sphinx/html/cython/zerodim.html#reservoir) object that contains a gas mixture at the prescribed inlet state. The mass flow rate from the upstream reservoir into the reactor is maintained at the desired value using a Cantera [`MassFlowController()`](https://cantera.org/documentation/docs-2.4/sphinx/html/cython/zerodim.html#massflowcontroller). Then on the outlet side, we define a second (downstream) `Reservoir()` into which the outlet gas mixture flows. On the outlet side, a pressure regulator (a Cantera [`Valve()`](https://cantera.org/documentation/docs-2.4/sphinx/html/cython/zerodim.html#valve) object) is used to maintain the reactor at the desired pressure. \n",

    "For low reactor temperatures, the outlet composition remains close to the inlet composition: there is little conversion from reactants to products. The n-heptane and O2 mole fractions decrease with increasing reactor temperature, while CO mole fraction increases with increasing reactor temperature. The Cantera model captures the experimentally observed behavior. At still higher temperatures, presumably the CO mole fraction would decrease again as the conversion to CO2 becomes more complete."

    "From these results, it can seen that the blowout residence time for this system is between 10^-5 s and 10^-4 s. This range could be narrowed by performing simulations for intermediate residence time values. For long residence times, the temperature approaches the equilibrium temperature of ~2280.5 K (see above), and the mole fractions of CO and CO2 approach their equilibrium values. As the residence time decreases, but before blowout occurs, the mole fraction of CO increases and the mole fraction of CO2 decreases with decreasing residence time, reflecting increasing departures from equilibrium. Roughly speaking, the state of the mixture for a given value of the residence time in a constant-pressure adiabatic WSR corresponds to the state at some instant in time during the time evolution for a constant-pressure adiabatic fixed-mass reactor.\n",

    "Further insight into the finite-rate chemical kinetics can be gained by plotting key intermediate species mole (or mass) fractions in the reactor as functions of residence time, especially for residence times close to blowout."
