    "# Ignition Delay\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook was written by Dan Haworth. It was adapted from the Notebook \"batch_reactor_ignition_delay_NTC.ipynb\" at https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-jupyter/tree/master/reactors. It is intended as a tutorial to be used in parallel with Chapter 6 of the book \"An Introduction to Combustion: Concepts and Applications\" by Stephen R. Turns and Daniel C. Haworth. That book is referred to as \"Turns 4th ed.\" throughout this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook was last updated 17 February 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this tutorial is to provide further insight into the autoignition of a homogeneous ideal-gas mixture. The heat-release rate is defined, and negative-temperature-coefficient (NTC) behavior is introduced. Further examples of Pandas DataFrames are shown. We will use the thermodynamic properties and the reaction mechanism that are included in seiser.cti.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file \"seiser.cti\" (provided with this Notebook) must be placed in a folder or directory named \"data\" that is immediately below the folder or directory from which you have opened this Notebook. If you downloaded the .zip file that contains all of the tutorial Notebooks, the appropriate folder and file structure should be in place. The .cti file is also available at https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-jupyter/tree/master/reactors/data.\n",

    "As discussed earlier (Chapter 2 of Turns 4th ed., and tutorial Notebook 2_8_Chemical_equilibrium), given sufficient time, an isolated system that is initially not in thermochemical equilibrium (e.g., a fuel-air reactant mixture) will eventually reach a new thermochemical state that corresponds to equilibrium, subject to the constraints imposed (element conservation, and thermodynamic process: e.g., constant-pressure adiabatic, or constant-volume adiabatic). \n",
    "\n",
    "For initial conditions (pressure, temperature, and composition) that are representative of fuel-air reactant mixtures in practical combustion applications, the time that is available for combustion is relatively short: much less than 1 s, in most cases. For a homogeneous, isolated fuel-air mixture at such conditions, one typically observes an *induction period* in which the fuel and air start to break down relatively slowly, followed by a rapid (but not instantaneous) change to the final equibrium state (*autoignition*) at a time that is referred to as the *ignition-delay time*. We have seen this behavior in earlier tutorial Notebooks: 4_3_Constant_volume_reactor, 5_2_Global_reactions, and 5_4_A_larger_reaction_mechanism for constant-volume adiabatic systems, and 4_4_Chemical_time_scales for a constant-pressure adiabatic system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ignition-delay time of a reactant mixture is very sensitive to rates at which chemical reactions occur (chemical kinetics). Comparisons between measured and computed ignition-delay times over a range of initial conditions are therefore often used to develop and validate reaction mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous tutorials, we have taken the time at which the temperature increases rapidly toward its final (equilibrium) value as the ignition-delay time. There are usually large differences between the final equilibrium states for constant-volume versus constant-pressure adiabatic systems. But in most cases, the differences between the ignition-delay times for constant-volume versus constant-pressure adiabatic systems are small, because the changes in mixture pressure and temperature from their initial values remain small up to the point of ignition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignition-delay time can be defined based on the time evolution of quantities other than temperature: for example, species mass or mole fractions, or *heat-release rate*. The heat-release rate is the rate at which chemical enthalpy (as quantified using species formation enthalpies) is converted to sensible enthalpy (or heat) in a combustion process. In terms of quantities that have been defined earlier in Turns 4th ed. and in previous tutorial Notebooks, the volumetric heat-release rate (denoted here as $ \\dot q _ {chem} $, with SI units W/m^3) can be written as the sum over all species in the mixture ($N_{spec}$ species) of the product of the species molar net production rate ($\\dot \\omega _i$ for species $i$, units of kmol_i/m^3-s: see tutorial Notebook 4_1_Chemical_kinetics_Cantera_basics) times the species molar formation enthalpy ($ \\overline h ^ 0 _{f,i} ( T_{ref}) $ for species $i$, units of J/kmol_i: see tutorial Notebook 2_4_Enthalpy), and with a sign change so that $ \\dot q _ {chem} >0 $ for an exothermic reaction:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot q _ {chem} = - \\sum _ {i=1} ^ {N_{spec}} \\Bigl( \\dot \\omega _ i \\overline h ^ 0 _{f,i} ( T_{ref}) \\Bigr) \\ .\n",

    "Here we consider autoigntion of n-heptane/air mixtures in a constant-volume adiabatic reactor. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in tutorial Notebook 4_3_Constant_volume_reactor, the governing equations are developed in Chapter 6 of Turns 4th ed. In Cantera, we do not need to explicitly provide the equations: they are implicitly embedded in Cantera's [`IdealGasReactor()`](https://cantera.org/documentation/docs-2.4/sphinx/html/cython/zerodim.html#idealgasreactor) object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use the reaction mechanism introduced in tutorial Notebook 5_4_A_larger_reaction_mechanism, but as we saw there, that mechanism requires long computational times. Instead, we will use a somewhat more compact n-heptane mechanism."

    "The peaks in OH and in heat-release rate occur at very close to the same instant in time, and both coincide to within a good approximation to the instant of maximum time-rate-of-change of temperature. Other good candidate species would be O or H.\n",
    "\n",
    "The curves could be made smoother by using a larger value of \"n_save\" above in performing the time integration, at the expense of longer computational time. If too small of a value of \"n_save\" had been used, the peaks might have been missed altogether. This is an advantage of using `step()` rather than `advance()` to perform the time integration, as the internal computational time step will automatically become smaller around the time of ignition, when the temperature and composition are changing rapidly.

    "From this, it can be seen that the nonuniform temperature intervals were chosen to resolve the nonmonotonic behavior of the ignition-delay time as a function of temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, one might expect that the ignition-delay time should be a monotonically increasing function of 1/T. That is, in fact, the case for many fuels burning with air, over at least some ranges of initial pressures, temperatures, and equivalence ratios. However, for some fuels (including n-heptane), there is a range of temperatures over which the ignition delay decreases as the temperature decreases (that is, as 1/T increases). This is called *negative temperature coefficient* (NTC) behavior. NTC behavior is important in some advanced compression-ignition engine combustion systems. This behavior can be difficult to capture in a reaction mechanism, and the ability to accurately capture ignition-delay times in the NTC region is often used as a test or validation case for reaction mechanisms that are to be used to predict autoignition in such systems."

    "Another phenomonon that can be seen for some fuels under some conditions is two-stage heat release, where there are two local peaks in the heat-release-rate-versus-time curve: an earlier lower peak (corresponding to low-temperature heat release) and a later higher peak that corresponds to the main ignition event (high-temperature heat release). The reasons for this behavior are beyond our introductory discussion of combustion. This is another phenomenon that is extremely sensitive to the details of the chemical kinetics. \n",
