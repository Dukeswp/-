    "Cantera provides a converter, [`ck2cti`](https://cantera.org/documentation/docs-2.4/sphinx/html/matlab/utilities.html#ck2cti), that accepts standard CHEMKIN input data files, and processes those to create a .cti file, which then can be used by Cantera. Additional information on file formats and conversions can be found at https://cantera.org/tutorials/ck2cti-tutorial.html. File conversion is beyond the scope of our introductory coverage of combustion in general, and of Cantera in particular, but the interested reader should now have sufficient information to follow up on this as desired.

    "As noted in tutorial Notebook Getting_started_with_Cantera, Cantera input data can be provided in an alternative format to the .cti file, as a .xml file; see https://cantera.org/tutorials/input-files.html and https://cantera.org/tutorials/cti/cti-processing.html. The information provided in a .xml file is essentially the same as that provided in a .cti file, and we will not need to use .xml files for our purposes. The interested reader can have a look at the file gri30.xml that is provided with the standard Cantera installation, and compare that with the file gri30.cti. "
