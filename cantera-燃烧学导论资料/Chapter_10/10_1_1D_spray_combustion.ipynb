    "# Steady One-Dimensional Spray Combustion\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook was written by Dan Haworth. It is intended as a tutorial to be used in parallel with Chapter 10 of the book \"An Introduction to Combustion: Concepts and Applications\" by Stephen R. Turns and Daniel C. Haworth. That book is referred to as \"Turns 4th ed.\" throughout this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook was last updated 21 February 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this tutorial are to show how to implement and solve a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations plus ancillary equations using Cantera, where the equations correspond to a simplified model for steady one-dimensional spray combustion. The model is exercised to illustrate key trends. We will use the thermodynamic properties and molecular transport properties that are included in seiser.cti.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file \"seiser.cti\" must be placed in a folder or directory named \"data\" that is immediately below the folder or directory from which you have opened this Notebook. If you downloaded the .zip file that contains all of the tutorial Notebooks, the appropriate folder and file structure should be in place. The .cti file is also available at https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-jupyter/tree/master/reactors/data.\n",

    "The model is developed at the end of Chapter 10 of Turns 4th ed. The key simplifications/assumptions are given there. In particular, it is assumed that the local gas temperature and composition at any spatial location $x$ are the values corresponding to the local equilibrium values (equilibrium for given mixture enthalpy and pressure) at that location. Therefore, we do not need a reaction mechanism, but we do need thermodynamic properties for both the liquid fuel and the gas-phase mixture, and transport properties for the gas-phase mixture; the latter are needed to compute the fuel vaporization rate. All fuel properties are constant in this model, and the liquid fuel temperature is equal to the boiling temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 3 below, we set up and solve the problem that is posed in Example 10.5 of Turns 4th ed. In the problem statement, an \"initial temperature\" (denoted as $ T_{r0} $ in the following) is given, and two equivalence ratios are given: an \"overall equivalence ratio\" ($ \\Phi _ {OA} $) and a \"premixed equivalence ratio\" ($ \\Phi _ {g0} $). These quantities are used as follows to set the initial conditions (at $x=0$) for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The given initial temperature $ T_{r0} $ corresponds to the temperature of a fuel/oxidizer reactant mixture at the given value of the premixed equivalence ratio. Because we assume that the gas-phase combustion is infinitely fast, the $x=0$ gas temperature ($T_{g0}$) is *not* equal to $ T_{r0} $; rather, $T_{g0}$ is the equilibrium temperature corresponding to a fuel/oxidizer mixture at the given initial temperature $ T_{r0} $ and the given premixed equivalence ratio $ \\Phi _ {g0} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \"overall equivalence ratio\" $ \\Phi _ {OA} $ is an equivalence ratio that accounts for both the liquid fuel and the vapor fuel. As the liquid fuel droplets vaporize, the local gas-phase equivalence ratio increases. If all of the liquid fuel were to vaporize completely, the gas-phase equivalence ratio would then be equal to $ \\Phi _ {OA} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "* All of the oxidizer enters the system in the gas phase at $ x = 0 $. The term $ \\dot m_a ' $ in Turns Chapter 10 is equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The initial ($x=0$) liquid fuel mass flow rate ($ \\dot m _ {l0} $) can be calculated directly from the known values of the liquid mass density $ \\rho _ l $ (= constant), the initial droplet velocity $v_{d0}$, and the total fuel injection area $A_{inj}$ as $ \\dot m _ {l0} = \\rho _ l v_{d0} A_{inj} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The stoichiometric fuel/oxidizer mass rate ($(F/O)_{stoich}$) can be computed in the usual way (see Chapter 2 of Turns 4th ed.) from the given fuel (here n-heptane) and oxidizer (here pure $O_2$) compositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following relationships then pertain among the oxidizer mass flow rate $ \\dot m _ a $, the vapor fuel mass flow rate $ \\dot m _ F $, the gas mass flow rate $ \\dot m _ g $, and the liquid mass flow rate $ \\dot m _ l $ (all in kg/s). Here a subscript $0$ denotes an initial ($x=0$) value of that quantity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\dot m _ a = constant $$\n",
    "$$ \\dot m_ F = \\dot m _ F (x) \\ , \\ \\dot m_ g = \\dot m _ g (x) \\ , \\ \\dot m_ l = \\dot m _ l (x) $$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\dot m _ {l0} + \\dot m _ {F0}}{\\dot m _ a} = \\Phi_{OA} ( F/O )_{stoich} $$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\dot m _ {F0}}{\\dot m _ a} = \\Phi_{g0} ( F/O )_{stoich} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "From these expressions, the initial ($x=0$) mass flow rates can all be determined.\n",

    "No standard predefined Cantera object is available for this system. Therefore, as was the case in Cantera tutorial Notebook 4_1_ODE_integration_thermal_NO, we will explicitly code the system of nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and ancillary algebraic equations that must be solved, and we will solve them using [`solve_ivp()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html).\n",

In the equilibrium calculations, full equilibrium will be computed using all of the species that are considered in the gas-phase input data file, rather than considering only the major species. And while the (here constant) liquid fuel properties could in principle be taken from an appropriate Cantera input data file, here we will specify the necessary properties directly for the fuel of interest (n-heptane).

    "Again, there is an unphysical spike at a point immediately before the droplets have fully vaporized, because of the way that we chose to store the data. Aside from that, the results are similar to those shown in Figure 10.20 for this value of the initial droplet diameter (50 micrometers). The gas speed increases as a consequence of vaporization (higher gas mass flow rate) up to the point where all droplets have vaporized. The droplet speed starts at the prescribed initial value of 10 m/s, and increases as a consequence of drag until it is essentially equal to the gas speed. Again, droplet vaporization is somewhat faster here compared to the results shown in Chapter 10."

    "The general shape of the curve is similar to that shown in Figure 10.19 of Turns 4th ed. for this value of the initial droplet diameter (50 micrometers). The temperature first increases with $x$ as the equivalence ratio increases through its stoichiometric value, then decreases as a consequence of the lower equilibrium temperature for the final very-fuel-rich mixture, in addition to the reduction in temperature as a consequence of the enthalpy required to vaporize the liquid fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperatures are higher here compared to those shown in Figure 10. This is most likely a consequence of differences in thermodynamic property data used here versus there. Also, the equilibrium state that is computed here accounts for a larger set of species. It is presumably the higher gas temperatures computed here that are responsible for the faster vaporization."

    "Again, the general shape of the curve is similar to that shown in Figure 10.19 of Turns 4th ed. for this value of the initial droplet diameter (50 micrometers). The gas-phase equivalence ratio is equal to 0.45 at x=0, the value that is given in the problem statement for the initial premixed fuel/oxidizer mixture. It then increases to a final value of 2.3 (the given overall equivalence ratio value) after all of the fuel has vaporized."

    "You can rerun the model for different values of the initial droplet diamter, and compare the results with those shown in Figures 10.19 and 10.20 of Turns Chapter 10. The present results are largely consistent with those shown in Chapter 10, with the exception of the someshat higher gas temperatures and the resulting faster vaporization rates here compared to there. An \"elegant\" way to do that would be to encapsulate this full model in a function, and to run that function for multiple values of the initial droplet diameter.\n",
