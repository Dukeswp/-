    "# Heating Value\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook was written by Dan Haworth, borrowing from the tutorial Notebook \"heating_value.ipynb\" that is available at https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-jupyter/tree/master/thermo. It is intended as a tutorial to be used in parallel with Chapter 2 of the book \"An Introduction to Combustion: Concepts and Applications\" by Stephen R. Turns and Daniel C. Haworth. That book is referred to as \"Turns 4th ed.\" throughout this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook was last updated 7 February 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this tutorial Notebook are to review the concept of heating values, and to show how to compute heating values using Cantera's `Solution()` object, together with properties for liquid water using Cantera's `Water()` object. We will define the gas mixture using gri30.cti.\n",

    "The *heating value* is defined as the enthalpy of a reactant mixture (a specified fuel-oxidizer mixture), minus the enthalpy of the resulting (idealized) product mixture, for the case where the reactants and the products are at the same pressure and temperature:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Heating \\ Value \\equiv H_{reactants} - H_{products} \\ , \\ {\\rm with \\ reactants \\ and \\ products \\ at \\ the \\ same \\ pressure \\ and \\ temperature} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The heating value is conventionally reported as a fuel property. It is a measure of the chemical energy that is available for eventual conversion to sensible energy (heat) in a combustion process, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in previous tutorial Notebooks, here we are interested primarily in fuels that contain (at most) carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms ($C_xH_yO_z$), burning with our standard approximation for air (21% $O_2$ and 79% $N_2$ on a volume or molar basis). For the products, we consider complete combustion in the sense defined earlier (tutorial Notebook 2_3_Stoichiometry), so that all fuel carbon oxidizes to form $CO_2$ and all fuel hydrogen oxidizes to form $H_2O$. And we again assume that $N_2$ does not participate chemically. For the case of a stoichiometric reactant mixture and complete combustion, the global reaction can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_x H_y O_z + (x+y/4-z/2)( O_2 + 3.76 N _ 2 ) \\rightarrow x CO_2 + y/2 H_2 O + 3.76 (x+y/4-z/2) N_2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The heating value for a specified fuel can be reported either on a per-unit-mass-of-fuel basis or on a per-unit-mole-of-fuel basis. The numerical value of the heating value is the same for pure oxygen ($O_2$) as the oxidizer as for our usual approximation for air as the oxidizer, since the enthalpy of the $N_2$ is the same in the reactants and in the products (which, for purposes of defining the heating value, are at the same pressure and temperature). \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, heating values are normally reported at the standard reference temperature (298.15 K) and pressure (1 atm). Since water can be either a liquid or a vapor at the reference temperature and pressure, it is conventional to define two heating values: a *lower heating value* (LHV) corresponding to the product water being in the vapor state, and a *higher heating value* (HHV) corresponding to the product water being in the liquid state. The two values differ by the change in enthalpy associated with condensing the product water from a vapor to a liquid at the reference pressure and temperature: i.e., by the enthalpy of vaporization of the product water. In most cases, the lower heating value of a fuel (rather than the higher heating value) is used as the basis for comparing the relative energy content of different fuels.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this background, let's see how we can compute heating values using Cantera."
