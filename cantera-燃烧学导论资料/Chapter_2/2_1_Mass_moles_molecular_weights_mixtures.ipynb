    "# Mass, Moles, Molecular Weights, and Mixtures\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook was written by Dan Haworth. It is intended as a tutorial to be used in parallel with Chapter 2 of the book \"An Introduction to Combustion: Concepts and Applications\" by Stephen R. Turns and Daniel C. Haworth. That book is referred to as \"Turns 4th ed.\" throughout this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook was last updated 3 February 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this tutorial Notebook is to introduce the various ways in which the quantity and composition of the material in a physical system of interest can be specified and manipulated using Cantera's [`Solution()`](https://cantera.org/documentation/docs-2.4/sphinx/html/cython/importing.html#cantera.Solution) object. The emphasis is on gas mixtures -- ideal-gas mixtures, in particular -- that contain varying amounts of different molecules or species. Element-based and species-based descriptions are reviewed. Further examples of array use (e.g., two-dimensional arrays) and formatted output are provided. And important distinctions among different classes of attributes (specifically, arrays and lists versus functions) are shown, which will be useful in subsequent tutorials. We will define the gas mixture using gri30.cti.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reader should be familiar with the material in the previous Notebook (Getting_started_with_Cantera) before working through this Notebook."

    "The quantity of matter in a system of interest can be specified in terms of its mass, or in terms of the number of molecules that it contains. In a molecular description, it is more convenient and conventional to work with moles, rather than directly with the actual number of molecules. As discussed in the previous Notebook, a mole is a quantity of matter that contains $N_A$ elementary entities (molecules, in the systems of interest here), where $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the previous Notebook, SI units are used in Cantera for mass (kg) and for other quantities, with the exception of moles. In Cantera, kmoles (kmol) are used instead of moles, so that the value of $N_A$ that is used internally in Cantera is 1,000 times the standard SI value. \n",
    "\n",
    "One can move back and forth between a mass-based description and a molar description using the molecular weight, which is the mass per unit mole (or kmol) of the substance of interest. The use of kg for mass and kmol for moles has the advantage that the numerical value of the molecular weight (or molar mass) in kg/kmol is equal to the molecular weight in atomic mass units (amu). Turns 4th ed. follows the same convention.\n",

For example, the approximate molecular weight of methanol (CH3OH, species index 20 - each molecule contains 1 atom of carbon, 1 atom of oxygen, and 4 atoms of hydrogen) is: (1x12kg/kmol) + (1x16kg/kmol) + (4x1kg/kmol) = 32 kg/kmol. Note that following convention, the species name for methanol is written in a way that reflects its molecular structure, as a methyl (CH3) group attached to a hydroxyl (OH) group.\n",

    "The lowest molecular weight here is for hydrogen atoms (H), and the highest is for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In other chemical mechanisms, species having higher molecular weights may be present. For example, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are molecules made up of multiple connected benzene rings, and the molecular weights of PAHs can be in the 100's of kg/kmol. PAHs are important as soot precursors. As we will see in Chapter 7 of Turns 4th ed., and will discuss in a tutorial Notebook for that chapter, species having lower (higher) molecular weights diffuse faster (slower) in a gas mixture, and this differential species diffusion can have consequences for flame structure and stabililty."

With $N_{spec}$ denoting the number of species in the mixture, and $ \\chi _ i $ and $ MW _ i$ the mole fraction and molecular weight of species $i$ in the mixture, the mixture molecular weight $MW$ is given by: $ MW = \\sum _ {i=1} ^ {N_{spec}} \\bigl( \\chi _ i MW _ i \\bigr) $. The mixture molecular weight thus depends on the composition of the mixture, but not on its current thermodynamic state (e.g., mixture pressure and temperature).\n",

    "The reactants molecular weight is higher than the products molecular weight, but the difference is less than 5%. As a useful first approximation for some purposes, the molecular weight can be treated as being constant during the combustion process for hydrocarbon-air mixtures. Moreover, we note that the reactants molecular weight and the products molecular weight are both close to (but greater than) the molecular weight of N2. This is because the mole fraction of N2 in both the reactants and in the products is greater than 70%. Finally, we note that during the combustion event itself, many intermediate species are present that are neither in the initial reactants nor in the final products. Many of the intermediates are small low-molecular-weight molecules, which lower the overall molecular weight of the mixture, if only for a brief time, during the combustion process. We will see this later, as we progress through subsequent chapters of Turns 4th ed. and subsequent tutorial Notebooks.\n",

    "Key thermodynamic properties of individual species and of mixtures that are needed in our development of combustion (specific heats, enthalpies, etc.) will be discussed in subsequent tutorials. Here we note that an ideal-gas mixture (e.g., air) can be treated as a simple compressible substance with appropriate mixture-averaged properties. Mixture molecular weight was introduced in Section 3.1 above. For other properties, the appropriate mixture-averaged value is defined as either the mass-fraction-weighted sum over the individual species properties or the mole-fraction-weighted sum over the individual species properties, depending on whether the property of interest is on a per-unit-mass or a per-unit-mole basis.\n",
